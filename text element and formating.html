    <center><h4>Poem</h4></center>
    <center><p>
        "HOPE" is the thing with feathers<br> 
        That perches in the soul,<br>And the tune without the words,<br>And never stops at all.<br><br>
        And sweetest is the gale is heard;<br>
        And sore must be storm<br>
        That could abad little bird<br>
        That keep so many  warm
        <br><br>
        I've heard it in the chillest land<br>
        And on the strongest sea <br>
        Yet,never , in extremity,<br>
        It asked a crumb of me.
        <br><br><br>
